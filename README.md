This lightweight tool ideal for small teams, or compact projects. It helps you manage Houdini scenes efficiently, load animation caches easily, and includes bonus utilities like copying code snippets across your workgroup. A smart helper to stay organized and speed up your workflow without the overhead of a full pipeline.

1. Download the contents of this repository as ZIP
2. Unzip the contents of the archive "btool-master" into your user folder (for ex `C:\Users\<USER>\Documents\houdinixxx\`)  
   so as a result you will have `C:\Users\<USER>\Documents\houdinixxx\btool-master`
3. Pick one file `btool.json` from there and move it into `packages` folder of your houdini user directory  (create it if it does not exist)  
   for ex. the full path will look like `C:\Users\<USER>\Documents\houdinixxx\packages\btool.json`
4. Enjoy!
